### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**AdyStudios/AdyStudios** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently not working on anything useful...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently not learning, becasue I'm lazy...
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone, I guess,
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with cool stuff...
- ğŸ’¬ Don't ask me about Minecraft...
- ğŸ“« Talk with me on Discord: .adyendre
